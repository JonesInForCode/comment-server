# Interactive Comment Component Backend Server

This is the repo for the backend of the Interactive comment component from frontendmentor. It was originally supposed to be a challenge in building out the styling, Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies in
the frontend using HTML/JavaScript or React/Vue/Etc. However I wanted to take on the extra challenge of serving a Full Stack CRUD WebApp using React and Node. The backend will be hosted by render.com and the frontend will
be hosted on Netlify.
